VERBS — COMPLETE GUIDE (Sensei mode: clear, simple, many examples, diagrams)

------------------------------------------------------------
0) QUICK QUESTIONS (to orient your brain)
------------------------------------------------------------
• Does the word show an ACTION? (run, eat, write)
• Does it show a STATE/BEING? (am, is, seem, belong)
• Does it show something HAPPENING to the subject? (was broken)

If YES → it is probably a VERB.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) DEFINITION
------------------------------------------------------------
A VERB is a word that tells:
• what someone/something DOES,
• what someone/something IS,
• or what HAPPENS to someone/something.

Core idea (80/20):
VERB = ACTION or STATE.

Examples:
• Action: run, read, jump, build
• State: am, is, feel, seem, exist

------------------------------------------------------------
2) BIG MAP — TYPES OF VERBS (ASCII TREE)
------------------------------------------------------------

VERB
├── MAIN (LEXICAL)
│   ├── Action
│   │   ├── Transitive
│   │   └── Intransitive
│   ├── Linking
│   └── Stative
└── HELPING (AUXILIARY)
    ├── Primary (be, have, do)
    └── Modal (can, may, must, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------
3) MAIN (LEXICAL) VERBS
------------------------------------------------------------

========================
A) ACTION VERBS
========================
They show DOING.

Examples:
• She runs.
• They built a bridge.
• I write daily.
• The dog barked.
• We are studying.
• He jumps high.

----------------------------------
Transitive (needs an object)
----------------------------------
Pattern: SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT

Examples:
• She wrote a letter.
• They built a house.
• He kicked the ball.
• I solved the problem.

----------------------------------
Intransitive (no object)
----------------------------------
Pattern: SUBJECT + VERB

Examples:
• She slept.
• The baby cried.
• They arrived.
• He laughed.

========================
B) LINKING VERBS
========================
They CONNECT the subject to a description.
They do not show action.

Common linking verbs:
am, is, are, was, were, seem, become, appear, feel (when meaning “state”)

Examples:
• She is smart.
• They are happy.
• The soup smells good.
• He became a doctor.
• It seems difficult.

ASCII picture:

SUBJECT ----(linking verb)----> DESCRIPTION

========================
C) STATIVE VERBS
========================
They describe states, thoughts, feelings — NOT actions.

Do NOT usually take “continuous” form.

Common stative verbs:
know, believe, like, love, hate, own, belong, understand, remember

Examples:
• I know the answer.
• She believes you.
• They own a car.
• This book belongs to me.
• He understands the topic.

(WRONG) I am knowing → (CORRECT) I know

------------------------------------------------------------
4) HELPING (AUXILIARY) VERBS
------------------------------------------------------------
They help main verbs to show:
• tense
• voice
• questions
• negatives

========================
A) PRIMARY AUXILIARIES
========================

(1) BE — am, is, are, was, were, being, been
Used for CONTINUOUS and PASSIVE.

Examples (continuous):
• I am learning.
• She was cooking.
• They are playing.

Examples (passive):
• The car was repaired.
• The work is done.

(2) HAVE — have, has, had
Used for PERFECT tenses.

Examples:
• I have finished.
• She has eaten.
• They had left.

(3) DO — do, does, did
Used for questions, negatives, emphasis.

Examples:
• Do you like tea?
• She does not agree.
• I did finish the task.

========================
B) MODAL AUXILIARIES
========================
Show ability, permission, possibility, obligation.

Common modals:
can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would

Examples:
• I can swim.
• You should study.
• She may come.
• They must leave.
• We will help.

❌ She are happy
✔ She is happy

❌ He did not went
✔ He did not go

❌ I am knowing this
✔ I know this

❌ They was playing
✔ They were playing

------------------------------------------------------------
7) NEXT — HOW TO PROCEED
------------------------------------------------------------
1) Identify verb in every sentence.
2) Ask: ACTION or STATE?
3) If action: transitive or intransitive?
4) If helper: primary or modal?

Practice daily with real examples.

------------------------------------------------------------
8) EXPECTED DOUBTS (NORMAL)
------------------------------------------------------------
• Difference between “do” and “did”
• When to use “have been / had been”
• Passive vs active
• Continuous vs simple tense
• “To be” vs action verbs

We can cover each next — step by step.
